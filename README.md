# DESCRIPTION
This project focuses on performing Sentiment Analysis on a dataset of customer reviews to classify them as positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool used in business, marketing, and social media monitoring to understand how customers feel about products or services based on their written feedback.

The implementation makes use of the TF-IDF vectorization technique to convert text data into numerical features and a Logistic Regression model to classify the sentiments. The project involves several key steps including data preprocessing, vectorization, model training, and evaluation. It demonstrates a complete workflow for solving a real-world NLP problem using Python and Scikit-learn.

# PROJECT OVERFLOW
Importing Required Libraries: Libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib are used for data handling, model training, and evaluation.

Loading the Dataset: The dataset is read using pandas.read_csv(), and a quick exploratory data analysis is performed to inspect the number of positive and negative reviews.

Text Preprocessing: Each review is cleaned by:

Lowercasing Removing punctuation and special characters Removing stopwords Tokenization (splitting into words)

# RESULTS
The model performs well on unseen reviews, accurately predicting their sentiment. This proves the effectiveness of combining TF-IDF with Logistic Regression for text classification tasks. Visualization of the confusion matrix and classification report helps in understanding how well the model is distinguishing between positive and negative sentiments.
